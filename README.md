# vuepidgeon
A lightweight Vue.js 3 Application that can read from a Google Spreadsheet and Render Content on the web. 

## Problem
I need to create a stylish and reactive FE experience but the underlying data needs to be maintained by non-technical users. A CMS would be overkill but something CRUD-like would work perfectly. 

## Aim
Create a Vue JS FE that can connect to a Google Sheet via an API key that gives read only access. Grab Data and render the needed FE.
